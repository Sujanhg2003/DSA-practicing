## DSA  problem solvig Patterns

### A. Array & String Patterns

#### Two Pointers

Move two pointers from start/end to solve problems like sum, palindrome, subarrays.

Example: Find two numbers in a sorted array that sum to target.

#### Sliding Window

Maintain a "window" of elements to solve subarray/subsequence problems.

Example: Maximum sum subarray of size k, longest substring with distinct characters.

#### Prefix Sum

Precompute cumulative sums to answer range sum queries efficiently.

Example: Subarray sum equals k problem.

#### Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm

Maximum subarray sum problem.

#### Cyclic / Rotation Patterns

Circular arrays, rotate problems, mod operations.

#### Frequency Counting / Hashing

Count occurrences or find duplicates.

Example: Two sum, anagrams, majority element.
